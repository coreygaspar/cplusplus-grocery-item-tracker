# cplusplus-grocery-item-tracker
An item tracker written in C++ that reads item purchase frequency from a text file and the user can search for items in this list, display all item frequencies, generate a histogram of all item frequencies, and exit the program. The frequency data is then backed up to a separate file called frequency.dat.
